        <h1>Rasperry Pi</h1>
        <p>This Microcontroller board is a great choice for powering numerous electronic projects.<br> Unlike other Raspberry Pi Boards, <br>Pico doesn't run any operating system; instead, it runs a simple code written in MicroPython or C on a Computer which is later uploaded on it.One end of the board has a Micro-USB port which, when used with <br> USB cable, powers the board and allows it to communicate to our computer for programming. The other end has a debug port for debugging<br style="color:DodgerBlue;"></p>
    <p>Sensors and Actuators Working principle<br>A DC servo motor is an assembly of four major components,

        DC motor
        Position sensing device
        Gear assembly
        Control circuit
        In digital control, micro controller used for generating the PWM pluses in terms of duty cycles to produce more accurate control signals.
        
        Working principle 
        
        The position sensor provide a feedback signal corresponding to the present position of the load. This sensor is normally a potentiometer<br> 
        that produces the voltage corresponding to the absolute angle of the motor shaft through gear mechanism.<br>
         Then the feedback voltage value applies on the input of error amplifier.
        <br>HC-SR04 Hardware Overview
        An HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor actually consists of two ultrasonic transducers.
        
        One acts as a transmitter that converts the electrical signal into 40 KHz ultrasonic sound pulses.
        <br>

        The other acts as a receiver and listens for the transmitted pulses.
        
        When the receiver receives these pulses, it produces an output pulse whose width is proportional to the distance of the object in front.
        VCC supplies power to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. You can connect it to the 5V output from your Arduino.
        <br>Trig (Trigger) pin is used to trigger ultrasonic sound pulses. By setting this pin to HIGH for 10Âµs, the sensor initiates an ultrasonic burst.

        Echo pin goes high when the ultrasonic burst is transmitted and remains high until the sensor receives an echo, after which it goes low.<br> 
        By measuring the time the Echo pin stays high, the distance can be calculated
