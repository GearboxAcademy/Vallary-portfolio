                <h3>Module 1:Introduction to Embedded Systems</h3>
                <p>This module provides an introduction to the fundamentals of embedded systems, including hardware and software design, project management, IDEs such as Thonny, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and MicroPython.
               <br>I will also carry out various projects throughout the module to gain hands-on experience with embedded systems development.I will define and explain the key concepts of embedded systems and apply project 
               <br> principles to embedded systems development using IDEs such as Thonny, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and MicroPython to develop embedded systems and carry out various projects</p>

                <h3>Module 2: Introduction to Embedded System II</h3>
                <p>This module mainly focuses on common electronic components used in embedded systems.An embedded as part of a complete device often including electrical or electronic hardware and mechanical parts.<br>
                   The elctronic components used include resistors, capacitors, transistorsand switches.The components are connected to form hardware circuitry which integrates with software such as arduino and thonny to provide project solutions.</p>

                <h3>Module 3: Introduction to Embedded System III</h3>
                <p>This module mainly focuses on ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers as platforms for developing embedded systems. ESP32 is a low-cost, low-power microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.<br>
                   The Arduino IDE uses a simplified version of the C++ programming language and is open-source.Some of the key areas will be writing,testing and debugging the firmware for your embedded system and finally deploying it.<br>
                   We will also carry out various projects using Esp32 and arduino IDE as the programming software</p>

                <p>This module mainly focuses on few communication protocols we need to know when building most electronics projects. In this module we will discuss the basics of the three most common protocols: SPI, I2C and UART.<br>
                   Communication between electronic devices is like communication between humans. Both sides need to speak the same language. In electronics, these languages are called communication protocols</p>
