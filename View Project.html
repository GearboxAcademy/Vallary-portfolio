                        <h2>Integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>
                        <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.It contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, <br> 
                           through a single graphical user interface (GUI). The user writes and edits source code in the code editor. The compiler translates the source code into a readable language that is executable for a computer.<br> 
                           And the debugger tests the software to solve any issues or bugs, e.g:
                           <h3>1.Thonny IDE</h3>
                           MicroPython is a programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware, for example,Raspberry Pi Pico. It is a full implementation of the Python (3) programming language.Programming Raspberry Pi Pico is a very easy process.<br>
                           Users can program the board by connecting it via USB port, and then just drag and drop the file into Raspberry Pi Pico.Added micropython UF2 file - Used for creating a software substrate able to directly transform your Python-like scripts<br>
                           into machine language code without the need to re-compile your code every time.<br>To download the Thonny Python IDE follow the given link: <a href="https://thonny.org/">https://thonny.org/</a> </p>


        <p>This Microcontroller board is a great choice for powering numerous electronic projects.<br> Unlike other Raspberry Pi Boards, <br>Pico doesn't run any operating system; instead, it runs a simple code written in MicroPython or C on a Computer which is later uploaded on it.One end of the board has a Micro-USB port which, when used with <br> USB cable, powers the board and allows it to communicate to our computer for programming. The other end has a debug port for debugging<br style="color:DodgerBlue;"></p>

        DC motor
        Position sensing device
        Gear assembly
        Control circuit
        In digital control, micro controller used for generating the PWM pluses in terms of duty cycles to produce more accurate control signals.
        
        Working principle 
        
        The position sensor provide a feedback signal corresponding to the present position of the load. This sensor is normally a potentiometer<br> 
        that produces the voltage corresponding to the absolute angle of the motor shaft through gear mechanism.<br>
         Then the feedback voltage value applies on the input of error amplifier.
        <br>HC-SR04 Hardware Overview
        An HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensor actually consists of two ultrasonic transducers.
        
        One acts as a transmitter that converts the electrical signal into 40 KHz ultrasonic sound pulses.
        <br>

        The other acts as a receiver and listens for the transmitted pulses.
        
        When the receiver receives these pulses, it produces an output pulse whose width is proportional to the distance of the object in front.
        VCC supplies power to the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor. You can connect it to the 5V output from your Arduino.
        <br>Trig (Trigger) pin is used to trigger ultrasonic sound pulses. By setting this pin to HIGH for 10Âµs, the sensor initiates an ultrasonic burst.

        Echo pin goes high when the ultrasonic burst is transmitted and remains high until the sensor receives an echo, after which it goes low.<br> 
        By measuring the time the Echo spin stays high, the distance can be c

                        <h2>MicroPython</h2>
                        <p>MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem. The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware.
