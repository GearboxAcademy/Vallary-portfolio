                        <h2>Integrated development environment (IDE)</h2>
                        <p>An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software suite that consolidates basic tools required to write and test software.It contains a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, and a debugger, <br> 
                           through a single graphical user interface (GUI). The user writes and edits source code in the code editor. The compiler translates the source code into a readable language that is executable for a computer.<br> 
                           And the debugger tests the software to solve any issues or bugs, e.g:
                           <h3>1.Thonny IDE</h3>
                           MicroPython is a programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware, for example,Raspberry Pi Pico. It is a full implementation of the Python (3) programming language.Programming Raspberry Pi Pico is a very easy process.<br>
                           Users can program the board by connecting it via USB port, and then just drag and drop the file into Raspberry Pi Pico.Added micropython UF2 file - Used for creating a software substrate able to directly transform your Python-like scripts<br>
                           into machine language code without the need to re-compile your code every time.<br>To download the Thonny Python IDE follow the given link: <a href="https://thonny.org/">https://thonny.org/</a> </p>
                           <h3>Arduino IDE</h3>
                            Arduino IDE is an open source software that is mainly used for writing and compiling the code into the Arduino Module.The IDE environment mainly contains two basic parts: Editor and Compiler where former is used for writing the required code<br>
                            and later is used for compiling and uploading the code into the given Arduino Module.<br>This environment supports both C and C++ languages.
                            Whenever youâ€™re using Arduino, you need to declare global variables and instances to be used later on. In a nutshell, a variable allows you to name and store a value to be used in the future <br>while a class is a collection of functions and variables that are kept together in one
                            place.
                            <h3>Raspberry Pi Pico</h3>
                            Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces.The Raspberry Pi Pico series is a range of tiny, fast, and versatile boards built using RP2040.Programmable in C and MicroPython,<br>
                            Pico is adaptable to a vast range of applications and skill levels, and getting started is as easy as dragging and dropping a file. Raspberry Pico is a wide range of flexible I/O options includes I2C, SPI, and - uniquely - Programmable I/O (PIO).<br>
                            These support endless possible applications for this small and affordable package.Below is Raspberry pinout:

                            <h3>MicroPython</h3>
                            MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem.<br>
                            The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware.Pico is programmed by connecting it to a computer via USB, then dragging and dropping a file onto it and adding a downloadable UF2 file to install MicroPython more easily.<br>
                            The UF2 file is suitable for flashing microcontrollers over MSC (Mass Storage Class; aka removable flash drive).
                            <h3>Project 1.1:Blink Onboard Led</h3>
                            Raspberry Pi Pico comes with an Onboard LED that is connected to GP25.I created a micropython program to blink the led on and off in a loop.Update your code so it looks like this:<br>
                            <iframe src="OnboardLed.htm" height="200" width="300" title="OnboardLed"></iframe><br>
                            Right now the LED is turning on and off.To stop the code simply click on the Stop button.For practical demonstration watch the video.<br>
                            <h3>Project 1.2:Blink External LED</h3>
                            For this example I will use a 2.5V LED and a 220 ohm resistor
