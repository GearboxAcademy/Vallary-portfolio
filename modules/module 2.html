                        <h2>Electronic Circuits and Components</h2>
                        <p>An electronic circuit is a structure that directs and controls electric current to perform various functions including signal amplification, computation, and data transfer. It comprises several different components such as resistors,<br>
                           transistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes. The simplest circuit consists of three elements, including a conducting path, a voltage source, and a load.The following are electronic circuits;<br>
                           <h4>1.Open Circuit</h4>
                           An open circuit is one in which the current can’t flow as one or more components are disconnected either intentionally (by using a switch) or accidentally (broken parts).<br>
                           One can also say it has an incomplete loop.
                           <h4>2.Closed Circuit</h4>A closed circuit is one that forms a loop without any interruptions.Currents finds a complete path to follow within a complete loop.
                           <h4>3.Short Circuit</h4>
                              A short-circuit, a low-resistance connection forms between two points in an electric circuit. As a result, the current tends to flow through this newly formed connection rather <br>
                              than along the intended path. For example, if there is a direct connection between the battery’s negative and positive terminal, the current will flow through it rather than passing through the circuit.<br>
                              In a short circuit current can flow at dangerously high levels that can damage electronic equipment and even cause explosions in some cases.
                            <h3>Sensors and Actuators</h3>
                            A sensor is an electrical instrument that monitors and measures physical aspects of an environment and sends an electrical signal to a control center when certain pre-determined conditions are detected.<br>
                            Sensors turn physical inputs into electrical signals that are output to the control center. They can monitor the health of equipment or the status of a sensitive environment.Sensors turn a physical input into an electrical output,<br>
                            and actuators do the opposite.They take electrical signals from control modules and turn them into physical outputs. They can perform a wide range of functions, from turning rotors and valves to virtually anything else.<br>
                            <h4>Physical Computing With Python</h4>
                            It involves interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes,<br>
                            is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world.It puts into use embedded microcontroller-based interactive systems<br>
                            that can sense the world around them and/or control outputs such as lights, displays and motors. Assembling the hardware elements of a physical computer and programming it to give desired behavior.<br>
                            <h4>Pulse Width Modulation</h4>
                            Allows you to give analogue behaviours to digital devices, such as LEDs. This means that rather than an LED being simply on or off, you can control its brightness.For this activity, you can use the circuit from the last step.<br>

                            <h3>MicroPython</h3>
                            MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem.<br>
                            The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware.Pico is programmed by connecting it to a computer via USB, then dragging and dropping a file onto it and adding a downloadable UF2 file to install MicroPython more easily.<br>
                            The UF2 file is suitable for flashing microcontrollers over MSC (Mass Storage Class; aka removable flash drive).
                            <h3>Project 1.1:Blink Onboard Led</h3>
                            Raspberry Pi Pico comes with an Onboard LED that is connected to GP25.I created a micropython program to blink the led on and off in a loop.Update your code so it looks like this:<br>
                            <iframe src="OnboardLed" height="200" width="300" title="OnboardLed"></iframe><br>
                            Right now the LED is turning on and off.To stop the code simply click on the Stop button.For practical demonstration watch the video.<br>
                            <h3>Project 1.2:Blink External LED</h3>
                            For this example I will use a 2.5V LED and a 220 ohm resistor
