                        <h2>Electronic Circuits and Components</h2>
                        <p>An electronic circuit is a structure that directs and controls electric current to perform various functions including signal amplification, computation, and data transfer. It comprises several different components such as resistors,<br>
                           transistors, capacitors, inductors, and diodes. The simplest circuit consists of three elements, including a conducting path, a voltage source, and a load.The following are electronic circuits;<br>
                           <h4>1.Open Circuit</h4>
                           An open circuit is one in which the current can’t flow as one or more components are disconnected either intentionally (by using a switch) or accidentally (broken parts).<br>
                           One can also say it has an incomplete loop.
                           <h4>2.Closed Circuit</h4>A closed circuit is one that forms a loop without any interruptions.Currents finds a complete path to follow within a complete loop.
                           <h4>3.Short Circuit</h4>
                              A short-circuit, a low-resistance connection forms between two points in an electric circuit. As a result, the current tends to flow through this newly formed connection rather <br>
                              than along the intended path. For example, if there is a direct connection between the battery’s negative and positive terminal, the current will flow through it rather than passing through the circuit.<br>
                              In a short circuit current can flow at dangerously high levels that can damage electronic equipment and even cause explosions in some cases.

                            Raspberry Pi Pico is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces.The Raspberry Pi Pico series is a range of tiny, fast, and versatile boards built using RP2040.Programmable in C and MicroPython,<br>
                            Pico is adaptable to a vast range of applications and skill levels, and getting started is as easy as dragging and dropping a file. Raspberry Pico is a wide range of flexible I/O options includes I2C, SPI, and - uniquely - Programmable I/O (PIO).<br>
                            These support endless possible applications for this small and affordable package.Below is Raspberry pinout:

                            <h3>MicroPython</h3>
                            MicroPython is a full implementation of the Python 3 programming language that runs directly on embedded hardware like Raspberry Pi Pico. You get an interactive prompt (the REPL) to execute commands immediately via USB Serial, and a built-in filesystem.<br>
                            The Pico port of MicroPython includes modules for accessing low-level chip-specific hardware.Pico is programmed by connecting it to a computer via USB, then dragging and dropping a file onto it and adding a downloadable UF2 file to install MicroPython more easily.<br>
                            The UF2 file is suitable for flashing microcontrollers over MSC (Mass Storage Class; aka removable flash drive).
                            <h3>Project 1.1:Blink Onboard Led</h3>
                            Raspberry Pi Pico comes with an Onboard LED that is connected to GP25.I created a micropython program to blink the led on and off in a loop.Update your code so it looks like this:<br>
                            <iframe src="OnboardLed" height="200" width="300" title="OnboardLed"></iframe><br>
                            Right now the LED is turning on and off.To stop the code simply click on the Stop button.For practical demonstration watch the video.<br>
                            <h3>Project 1.2:Blink External LED</h3>
                            For this example I will use a 2.5V LED and a 220 ohm resistor
